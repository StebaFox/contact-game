## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure and canvas elements
- **CSS3** - CRT effects, animations, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Game logic and interactivity
- **Canvas API** - Star map, waveforms, and spectrograms
- **Web Audio API** - Sound effects and music playback
- **LocalStorage** - Game state persistence

## File Structure

```
contact-seti-game/
├── index.html          # Main HTML structure
├── style.css           # Complete styling and CRT effects
├── game.js             # Game logic, mini-games, and narrative
├── README.md           # This file

```

## Game State Persistence

The game automatically saves your progress including:
- Scanned stars
- Analyzed signals
- Contacted civilizations
- Operator name
- Color scheme preference
- Volume settings
- Read emails

Progress is stored in your browser's localStorage and persists between sessions.

## Controls

- **Mouse** - Navigate menus and select targets
- **Click** - Interact with buttons and UI elements
- **Sliders** - Adjust volume and signal tuning parameters
- **Color Scheme Button** - Toggle between green and white display modes
- **Clear Cache Button** - Reset all game progress

## Customization

### Adding New Narrative Content

All narrative content is centralized in the `NARRATIVE` object at the top of `game.js`:

```javascript
const NARRATIVE = {
    bootSequence: { /* Boot messages */ },
    emails: { /* Email messages */ },
    alienContacts: [ /* Alien encounter data */ ]
};
```

### Modifying Star Data

Star information is stored in three arrays in `game.js`:
- `starNames` - Star/planet names
- `starTypes` - Stellar classification and temperature
- `discoveryDates` - Year of discovery/registration

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

Requires JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas support.
